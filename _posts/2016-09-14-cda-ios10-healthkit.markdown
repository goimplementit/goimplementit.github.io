IOS 10 came with a new version of Apple's HealthKit, enabling apps to import data from HL7 CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) and CCD (Continuity of Care Document) documents.
This will, in theory, enable patients to not only request their medical records, but also view them in an understandable format.

It seems like Apple has taken an interest in enabling patients to view, use and supplement their own healthcare data. It is therefore important for healthcare providers to be ready before their patients start demanding access to their own data in an easy and understandable format.

First step in accommodating these patients is to export their medical records not only as HL7 CDA/CCD documents, but as valid HL7 CDA/CCD documents. 

Luckilly GoImplement.it created an easy to use HL7 CDA document [validator](http://hl7-jkiddo.rhcloud.com/), enabling developers and healthcare professionals to check whether or not their CDA documents are ready for Apple HealthKit.
