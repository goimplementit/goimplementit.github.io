Medcom has made two danish profiles based on the following CDA standards:

  1) Questionnaire Form Definition Document (QFDD)  
  2) Questionnaire Response Document (QRD)  

In the context of remotely monitoring patients these two standards are important, since the electronic interchange of patients’ vital signs is but the first step in enabling effective dialogue. Of equal importance is the electronic interchange of meaningful questions and answers between the practitioner and the patient. 

Every self-respecting standard **MUST** have a validation tool in order to assist in the adoption of the standard. Because of this Medcom's PHMR validator is going back to school to learn QFDD and QRD with respect to the danish extensions.

GoImplement.it is proud to announce we got the job.

*The Medcom PHMR validator will after this project be able to validate three different danish CDA profiles*
